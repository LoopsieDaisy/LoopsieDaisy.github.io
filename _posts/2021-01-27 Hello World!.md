## Hello World!

If you dug deep enough to find this page, Hello! Welcome to my FIRST ever post here. 
Lets cut to the chase-- here are my 5 W's 

### Who

Someone who is excited to share about the results of their procrastination!
I love to crochet-- I started off with random things, like phone pouches, circles-- then I had a clothing phase where I created a larger chunky "vest", then a bandana, 
and now, you are DEFINITELY in for a treat. I am in my Amigurumi phase. 

### What
### Where

You would TOTALY NOT believe where this humongous operation is organized and executed from-- my bedroom.

### When

My relationship with crocheting and knitting has been a rollercoaster ride. We're an on and off couple that never seems to stay fully 'on' but also could never totally be apart.
My passion for them was refueled when my roommate of 2.5 years gifted me a yarn set for Christmas. Now here I am, writing this while technically still clocked in to work. 

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";
# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first
ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
